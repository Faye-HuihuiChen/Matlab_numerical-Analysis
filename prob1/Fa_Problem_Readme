#1: Use MATLAB code to write codes for the first $K=20$ terms of the sequence given by the following recurrence relation
%
x_0 = 1, x_1 = 1/3, x_{n+1} = 13/3* x_n- 4/3 x_{n-1}
State your observation, given that the sequence is none other than  LaTeX: x_n=(1/3)^nx n = ( 1 / 3 ) n.
Submit the plot of x_n vs n with written work.
